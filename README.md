Easily add LinkedIn Insight Tag to React.  
It is heavily inspired by [react-facebook-pixel](https://github.com/zsajjad/react-facebook-pixel) from [@zsajjad](https://github.com/zsajjad).

## Install
This repo is available via npm ([react-linkedin-insight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-linkedin-insight))
```bash
yarn add react-linkedin-insight
```
## Usage
Import, initialize and play. Too bad the LinkedIn Insight Tag does not have the abilities which the Facebook Pixel or Google Analytics have, but we can measure a page load and conversions.

```javascript
import LinkedInTag from 'react-linkedin-insight';

LinkedInTag.init(partnerId);
LinkedInTag.track(conversionId);
```

### Partner ID
You can get the partner ID from the script LinkedIn provides when you create an Insight Tag. The partner ID can be found on the second row of the code they provide: `_linkedin_partner_id = "123456";` where the `123456` is your partner ID.

### Conversion ID
Conversions can only be tracked if they are created within the LinkedIn Campaign Manager. Once an event-specific pixel is created, they will provide an image tag like `<img height="1" width="1" style="display:none;" alt="" src="https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=123456&conversionId=789012&fmt=gif" />`. The `789012` behind the `conversionId=` is your conversion ID.

### Tracking navigation with a client-side router
Currently there is no option in automatically tracking navigation with client-side routing. Input would be very helpful and appreciated. It could be opted to create a conversion in LinkedIn which is called 'virtualPageView' or so, but I don't think this is good practice. We should create a way in which LinkedIn registers a navigation change as a page load.
